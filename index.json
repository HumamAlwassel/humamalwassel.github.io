Despite the encouraging progress these methods achieve, it is crucial to design automated approaches that only explore parts of the video which are the most relevant to the actions being searched for. To address this need, we propose the new problem of *action spotting* in video, which we define as finding a specific action in a video while observing a small portion of that video. Inspired by the observation that humans are extremely efficient and accurate in spotting and finding action instances in video, we propose *Action Search*, a novel Recurrent Neural Network approach that mimics the way humans spot actions. Moreover, to address the absence of data recording the behavior of human annotators, we put forward the *Human Searches* dataset, which compiles the search sequences employed by human annotators spotting actions in the AVA and THUMOS14 datasets. We consider temporal action localization as an application of the action spotting problem. Experiments on the THUMOS14 dataset reveal that our model is not only able to explore the video efficiently (observing on average **17.3%** of the video) but it also accurately finds human activities with **30.8%** mAP.","tags":null,"title":"Action Search: Spotting Targets in Videos and Its Application to Temporal Action Localization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Humam Alwassel**","Fabian Caba Heilbron","Victor Escorcia","Bernard Ghanem"],"categories":null,"content":" BibTex @inproceedings{alwassel_2018_detad, title={Diagnosing Error in Temporal Action Detectors}, author={Alwassel, Humam and Caba Heilbron, Fabian and Escorcia, Victor and Ghanem, Bernard}, booktitle={The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)}, month={September} year={2018} }  ","date":1532476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532476800,"objectID":"285d2b927afb0d2b98a3a5eaa40cad0e","permalink":"https://humamalwassel.github.io/publication/detad/","publishdate":"2018-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/detad/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the recent progress in video understanding and the continuous rate of improvement in temporal action localization throughout the years, it is still unclear how far (or close?) we are to solving the problem. To this end, we introduce a new diagnostic tool to analyze the performance of temporal action detectors in videos and compare different methods beyond a single scalar metric. We exemplify the use of our tool by analyzing the performance of the top rewarded entries in the latest ActivityNet action localization challenge. Our analysis shows that the most impactful areas to work on are: strategies to better handle temporal context around the instances, improving the robustness w.r.t. the instance absolute and relative size, and strategies to reduce the localization errors. Moreover, our experimental analysis finds the lack of agreement among annotator is not a major roadblock to attain progress in the field. Our diagnostic tool is publicly available to keep fueling the minds of other researchers with additional insights about their algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Diagnosing Error in Temporal Action Detectors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Manual floating-point error analysis of scientific computing code is tedious and error-prone.
